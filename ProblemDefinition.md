<h1> Problem Definition: Objectives & List of Stakeholders </h1>  
 
 **Problem definitions** <br/>
The problem in the current system is that it does not offer efficient call routing that can support the large variety of holiday packages that are offered by the company. Inefficient call routing could mean longer time spent in call handling and not providing the customers with exact product knowledge they are acquiring in some cases.
The current system doesn’t provide a skill matching technique that matches customers with the relationship managers based on cultural backgrounds and language proficiency
Lack of an efficient and skill based target list that could be corresponding to customers/relationship managers profiles.

**Objectives**  
The objective of this project is to develop an information system that:<br/>
offers customers a less time consuming, overwhelming approach to the company.<br/>
improve the call flow rate of the company by using a skill matching based system that matches customers to relationship managers based on product knowledge and experience, and corresponding to cultural backgrounds and language proficiency among other things.<br/>
Creates a potential target customers list from existing databases, and offers each RM with guidelines and proposed product based on their product knowledge/experience.<br/>
Direct customers to interactive voice response that prompts the customer with options and handles call routing to relationship managers.<br/>

**Assumptions** <br/>
Company’s employees, apart from Relationship managers, are out of scope for this report. <br/>
A customer had created a profile using the profiler tool before calling the CMC. <br/>
The profiler tool is an external system that the new system interacts with. <br/>
RMs have to login to access the system using employee number and a pin. <br/>
RM needs to create a profile by answering a questionnaire at first before they can access the system. <br/>
The company's hardware is capable of supporting the new information system.
