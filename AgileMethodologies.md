<h3> Agile Methodologies </h3> <br/>
Using agile methodologies to approach information systems development promotes flexible planning, piecemeal development, early delivery, continued improvement, reduced risk and advances team members ability to respond to ambiguity. <br/>
<br/>
In this instance, our team decided to use the SCRUM approach to agile systems development. The SCRUM activitves we utilised in order to complete this project include: <br/>
<br/>
<h6> Initial Product Planning. </h6> <br/>
This was our teams initial meeting, while not specifically related to SCRUM, it is an important agile planning method. Here we discussed our individual visions for the product and collaborated on how they interact with one anothers. We created multilpe draft problem statements and refined it to just one that we can use to centre our work around. In this meeting we also created a product roadmap, we outlined a prelimary timeline we would like to adhere to in order to ensure the project was completed incrementally and enough time for review was allowed. <br/>
<br/>
<h6> Regular SCRUM Meetings. </h6> <br/>
There were held bi-weekly for the first half of the project timeline and then three times a week in the final half. At these meetings we discussed our progress of the last half week, reviewed the work other team members had done and devised goals we would like to achieve before the next SCRUM meeting. We agreed on tasks to be prioritised and analysed any impediments to our progress (e.g. if team member had other assignments due). <br/>
<br/>
<h6> Sprint Planning Meetings.</h6> <br/>
The ultimate purpose of these meetings was to commit to a sprint goal. Examples of this include; having our prototypes done, refining the class diagram, increasing the fidelity of our collaboration diagram. These were held once a week and the objectives for the week ahead were planned. We broke down the larger tasks into smaller tasks, assigning these to individuals. <br/>
<br/>
<h6> Sprint Reviews. </h6> <br/>
These were performed once a week to analyse our progress, compare it to our predicted timeline and create suggestions for the direction of future work. This also allowed team members to review the work of other team members, providing feedback and iteratively updating the work. These meetings were where we compiled a sprint backlog of completed tasks that were ready for the final report. Here we ensured consistency amongst the work of individual team members and collated the smaller tasks that were assigned in the sprint planning meeting. We also evaluated our performance over the last sprint and identified what worked well and what could be improved in the next sprint. <br/>
<br/>
<h6> Product Backlog. </h6> <br/>
This is a list of functional and non-functional requirements that reflect the vision our team has. This helps identify the individual tasks we should be working on throughout the project.
