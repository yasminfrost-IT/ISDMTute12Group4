<h3> Agile Methodologies </h3> <br/>
Using agile methodologies to approach information systems development promotes flexible planning, piecemeal development, early delivery, continued improvement and advances team members ability to respond to ambiguity. <br/>
<br/>
In this instance, our team decided to use the SCRUM approach to agile systems development. The SCRUM activitves we utilised in order to complete this project include: <br/>
<br/>
- Regular SCRUM meetings. <br/>
There were held bi-weekly. At these meetings we discussed. <br/>
<br/>
- Sprint planning meetings. <br/>
There were held once a week to plan the objectives for the week ahead. <br/>
<br/>
- Sprint reviews. <br/>
These were performed once a week to analyse our progress, compare it to our predicted timeline and create suggestions for the direction of future work. This also allowed team members to review the work of other team members, providing feedback and iteratively updating the work. These meetings were where we compiled a sprint backlog of completed tasks that were ready for the final report.
