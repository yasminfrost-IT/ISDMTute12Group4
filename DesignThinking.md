<h1> Design Thinking </h1>  
<h4> Empathise </h4>  
To approach the ‘empathise’ element of design thinking, our group created an empathy map. Here, we put ourselves in the customers position and were able to identify what the key needs and desires of the customer when they are contacting not only the company, but also the CMS. Having empathy is crucial to achieving human connection, so we interviewed people who identify as *regular travellers* to gain a deeper understanding on what they would want out of such a call centre. More specifically, what would motivate them to use this service over internet bookings that remove the intermediary? It has been repeatedly recognised that customers don't just want a service or a product, they want an experience also. Thus, it is crucial to the success of the CMS that the customer journey is complemented with staff expertly navigating their internal systems.    
  
<h4> Define </h4>  
When navigating the define element of design thinking we identified the core issues this project must tackle. They include: providing an unparralleled level of customer service, providing unique and accurate information about the desired travel destinations, showing our repeat customers that we value their loyalty through enhancements to our already high quality service.  
  
  
Through our interviews we identified that extremely knowledgable *Relationship Managers* are the most salient selling point of this system. Pursuantly, a lot of effort should be put into how best to match the customers need with a staff member who can provide them with great information, the RMs should be efficiently able to navigate the system to avoid any delays while liasing with customers. 
  
<h4> Ideate </h4>  
We found the Ideation technique of brainstorming to be very helpful. So, at this stage, we brainstormed possible solutions to the issues specified above. As we brainstormed, we thought about some customer service systems that we personally find incredibly efficient, easy to use and informative.  
  
There was a general concensus amongst our group that systems that have too many screens become clunky and hard to navigate. As a result, we want our system to have only a few main screens. 
  
<h4> Prototype </h4>  
At this stage we were able to get a little more creative. We started by doing a paper prototype, drawing multiple versions of the screen on a paper and doing a rough sketch of what we invision the system to look like. We incrementally increased the fidelity of such drawings and made sure to get feedback from other team members everytime something was changed. We then moved from a paper prototype to the web-based application proto.io to bring these drawings to life. The benefit of this application is that it helps you produce an interactive protoype. 
  
<h4> Test </h4>    
To test our interactive prototypes, we invited other students with no background knowledge in UI or IT to do user testing on our prototypes. Here we were able to identify if the way we designed the application was truly intuitive. These testers commented on where they think buttons would be better placed or if the colour of the screen seemed mismatched to the task at hand. After each user, the suggested changes were implemented and verified against the next testers opinion to ensure common concensus on the feedback.
